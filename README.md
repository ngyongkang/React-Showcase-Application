# React-Showcase-Application
A react application to showcase some small projects that will be complied into one application and be separated by components.

# Project Setup
Run the following commands with the npm software installed.
```
npm create vite
```
Vite is a conveient project setup that allows a preset to be downloaded. It offers other quite a few options besides "React".
However, for this project setup I will be using the React preset with the Javascript setup.

# Project Execution
Run the following npm commands to execute the different modes for the preset project.

Build Project Only:
```
npm run build
```

Development Environment:
